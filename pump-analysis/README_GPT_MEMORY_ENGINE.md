## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. GPTMemoryEngine Class
Main orchestrator for memory management and pattern recognition.

**Key Methods:**
- `register_detector_function()`: Saves new detectors with full context
- `get_similar_detectors()`: Finds patterns similar to current analysis
- `generate_context_for_gpt()`: Creates rich context for AI analysis
- `discover_meta_patterns()`: Identifies successful patterns across cases

#### 2. CryptoScanIntegration Class  
Handles integration with real-time crypto-scan system.

**Key Methods:**
- `check_symbol_pre_pump_detected()`: Verifies if crypto-scan caught the pump
- `get_ppwcs_performance_stats()`: Retrieves crypto-scan performance metrics
- `suggest_improvements_for_crypto_scan()`: AI-generated optimization suggestions

#### 3. Enhanced GPTAnalyzer
Updated to use memory context for improved function generation.

**New Methods:**
- `generate_pump_analysis_with_context()`: Analysis with historical context
- `generate_detector_function_with_context()`: Function generation with pattern recognition

## Data Flow

### 1. Pump Detection
When a pump is detected, the system:
1. Analyzes pre-pump conditions (RSI, volume, compression, etc.)
2. Searches for similar historical patterns
3. Checks if crypto-scan detected this pump beforehand
4. Generates rich context combining all sources

### 2. GPT Enhancement
GPT receives:
- Current pre-pump analysis
- 3-5 similar historical cases
- Crypto-scan correlation data
- Meta-patterns from successful detectors
- Performance feedback from previous functions

### 3. Function Generation
Enhanced GPT creates:
- More precise detection thresholds based on historical data
- Unique patterns avoiding duplication of previous logic
- Improved algorithms combining successful elements
- Better adaptation to current market conditions

### 4. Performance Tracking
System monitors:
- Function accuracy on new pump cases
- Crypto-scan correlation success rate
- Pattern evolution over time
- Learning effectiveness metrics

### Crypto-Scan Correlation
```python
from crypto_scan_integration import CryptoScanIntegration

# Check if crypto-scan detected this pump
integration = CryptoScanIntegration()
pre_pump_signal = integration.check_symbol_pre_pump_detected(
    symbol="BTCUSDT",
    pump_time=pump_event.start_time,
    window_hours=2
)

if pre_pump_signal:
    print(f"Crypto-scan detected! PPWCS: {pre_pump_signal['ppwcs_score']}")
```

### Pattern Discovery
```python
# Discover meta-patterns across successful detectors
patterns = memory.discover_meta_patterns()

for pattern in patterns:
    print(f"Pattern: {pattern['description']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {pattern['confidence']:.1%}")
