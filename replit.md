- **TJDE Override System**: Implemented automatic detection and override of 0.0 TJDE component values in scan_token_async.py, directly calling enhanced calculation functions when needed to ensure meaningful scores (trend_strength, pullback_quality, support_reaction, volume_behavior_score, psych_score) in production scanning
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Fixed missing flush_async_results() and save_async_result() functions, corrected import errors in crypto_scan_service.py, removed conflicting TJDE imports in trader_ai_engine.py, and fixed sequential fallback scan logic to prevent recursive async calls
- **Chart Generation Fixes**: Resolved matplotlib savefig linewidth parameter error in chart_generator.py, enhanced TJDE fallback scores to enable chart generation for testing, added forced chart generation for tokens with sufficient candle data regardless of low TJDE scores

- **Enhanced Async Infrastructure**: Added asyncio.Semaphore(15) rate limiting, comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff, 429/502 error handling
- **Thread-Safe Result Management**: Implemented global results collector with asyncio.Lock() preventing JSON corruption, batch saving to data/async_results/
- **Comprehensive Progress Tracking**: Per-token status logging ([123/750] SYMBOL: ✅/Skipped/Error), performance metrics (tokens/second), API call estimation
- **Production Error Handling**: Multi-retry async HTTP calls, timeout management, exception categorization (timeouts vs API errors vs data errors)

## User Preferences

- Language: Polish for user-facing messages and alerts
- API Access: Bybit API working in production environment (development environment shows 403 errors)
- Performance Priority: Speed through simplicity - complex optimizations often counterproductive 
- Code Style: Sequential execution preferred over parallel processing that adds overhead without benefit
- Architecture Preference: Simple, maintainable code over sophisticated but slow optimizations
- Scanning Logic: "przywróć dawną logike skanu" - user explicitly requested return to simple scanning approach
- Debugging: Basic logging without performance monitoring overhead that slows system
- Alert Style: Detailed technical analysis with specific condition breakdowns  
- System Monitoring: Real-time visibility into detection logic and failure reasons
- Error Handling: Graceful degradation when modules unavailable, avoid breaking system with complex dependencies
- Development Reality: API 403 errors in development environment are expected - system optimized for production where Bybit API works correctly
