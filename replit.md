# Crypto Pre-Pump Detection System

## Overview

This is a sophisticated cryptocurrency market scanner that detects pre-pump signals using advanced multi-stage analysis. The system monitors cryptocurrency markets in real-time, analyzes various indicators to identify potential pre-pump conditions, and sends alerts via Telegram with AI-powered analysis.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask Web Application**: Provides a dashboard interface for monitoring system status and viewing alerts
- **Python Service**: Main scanning service (`crypto_scan_service.py`) that continuously monitors markets
- **File-based Data Storage**: Uses JSON files for caching, storing alerts, reports, and configuration data
- **Real-time Processing**: Continuous market scanning with configurable intervals

### Frontend Architecture
- **Flask Templates**: HTML templates with Bootstrap styling for responsive design
- **JavaScript Dashboard**: Real-time data updates with auto-refresh functionality
- **RESTful API**: JSON endpoints for status, alerts, and market data

## Key Components
