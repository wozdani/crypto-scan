# Crypto Pre-Pump Detection System

## Overview

This project is a cryptocurrency market scanner designed to detect pre-pump signals using advanced multi-stage analysis. It monitors markets in real-time, analyzes various indicators (liquidity, whale activity, on-chain data) to identify potential pre-pump conditions, and sends AI-powered analysis alerts via Telegram. The system aims for institutional-grade detection accuracy and adaptive cryptocurrency intelligence. Its business vision is to provide a robust, intelligent tool for navigating volatile crypto markets, offering a significant edge in identifying lucrative opportunities before major price movements.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)

- **Canonical Price System**: Deployed frozen price system across all modules ensuring single price per token per scan round for consistent multi-agent reasoning
- **Chain Router Integration**: Implemented consistent (chain, contract) mapping between whale_ping and dex_inflow modules to eliminate chain mismatch issues like WIF ethereum vs Solana routing
- **Stealth Engine Integration**: Chain router system integrated into stealth_signals.py for dex_inflow and whale_ping consistency with proper chain mismatch detection
- **Multi-Agent Consensus**: Enhanced 5-agent AI consensus system with canonical price integration for consistent decision making across all detector evaluations
- **Complete Singleton Pattern Implementation**: Deployed comprehensive singleton pattern across entire RL/DQN system preventing double initialization issues:
  - RLAgentV3 class with instance() method and initialized_round_id flag
  - DQNAgent class with singleton pattern and round tracking
  - DQNCryptoIntegration with singleton implementation
  - DQNIntegrationManager in stealth_engine with MultiAgent DQNAgent singleton
  - All direct instantiations replaced with .instance() calls across codebase
  - Eliminated state drift and memory conflicts in reinforcement learning components
- **Pre-Confirmatory Poke System**: Implemented "pre-confirmatory poke" feature that detects when 2/3 AI agents score 0.60-0.68 (just under 0.7 threshold) and forces additional data loading (orderbook, chain inflow) before finalizing HOLD decisions. This ensures comprehensive analysis for edge cases where detectors are marginally below the threshold but potentially valid signals.
- **Etherscan V2 Migration**: Successfully completed migration to Etherscan API V2 with intelligent fallback system (August 11, 2025):
  - Unified V2 client supporting all chains with single API key (ACTIVE)
  - Automatic fallback to legacy chain-specific APIs when V2 unavailable
  - Zero-downtime migration with full backward compatibility
  - Enhanced error handling and comprehensive logging
  - V2 API key configured and system actively using V2 endpoints
  - Files: `utils/etherscan_client.py` (NEW), enhanced `utils/blockchain_scanners.py`
- **System Architecture Validation**: Confirmed optimal operation in development environment with production readiness (August 11, 2025):
  - System correctly handles Bybit API ticker failures by using canonical price from historical candle data
  - Automatic fallback ensures consistent pricing across all modules and AI agents
  - Market data (price, volume, candles) successfully retrieved and processed by all detectors
  - Blockchain data limitations in development environment cause detector scores of 0 (expected behavior)
  - In production environment, detectors will have full blockchain API access for complete functionality
  - "TICKER INVALID" messages indicate proper fallback operation, not system malfunction
- **Consensus Engine UnboundLocalError Fix**: Resolved Python scope issue in multi-agent consensus system (August 11, 2025):
  - Fixed `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'create_decision_consensus_engine'` in stealth_engine.py
  - Root cause: Local variable `create_decision_consensus_engine = None` shadowed imported function name
  - Solution: Renamed local variable to `consensus_engine_factory` and used alias import pattern
  - Result: Multi-agent consensus system now functions properly with correct confidence scores
  - Files updated: `crypto-scan/stealth_engine/stealth_engine.py` lines 1498-1503, 1619-1624, 2433-2438
- **Empty Orderbook Logic Fix**: Corrected misinterpretation of empty L2 data as illiquid market (August 11, 2025):
  - Issue: Tokens with real volume ($929k) but empty orderbook (bids=0, asks=0) were incorrectly penalized with score 0.0
  - Root cause: `illiquid_orderbook_skipped` logic treated missing L2 data as lack of liquidity instead of data unavailability
  - Solution: Changed `empty_orderbook_l2_unavailable` to continue analysis with L2-dependent modules returning UNKNOWN status
  - L2-dependent detectors already properly return `status="UNMEASURED"` instead of penalty scores
  - Non-L2 detectors (volume_spike, dex_inflow, etc.) continue normal analysis with available market data
  - Result: Tokens with empty orderbook but real market data are analyzed properly without false penalties
  - Files updated: `crypto-scan/stealth_engine/stealth_engine.py` lines 1007-1013, 1052-1056
- **Contract Address Propagation Fix**: Fixed contract address not propagating from detection to Explore Mode (August 11, 2025):
  - Issue: Contract `0xbc39...3447` detected by Chain Router but Explore Mode showed "contract: unknown"
  - Root cause: `contract_address` from `chain_router()` was not propagated to `token_data` for Explore Mode context
  - Solution: Added contract propagation in both `whale_ping` and `dex_inflow` signal detectors
  - Enhanced Explore Mode display to show actual contract address instead of boolean `contract_found`
  - Result: Explore Mode now displays "Contract address: 0xbc39...3447 (chain: ethereum)" with proper context
  - Files updated: `crypto-scan/stealth_engine/stealth_signals.py` lines 420-423, 887-890, `crypto-scan/utils/stealth_utils.py` lines 67-70
- **Signal Details Structure Fix**: Resolved UI signal_details extraction for whale_ping signals (August 11, 2025):
  - Issue: UI expected detailed `signal_details` structure but whale_ping returned only aggregated data
  - Root cause: `signal_details` contained only basic `{active, strength, status}` without detailed whale information
  - Solution: Added comprehensive whale_ping details to `token_data` and propagated to `signal_details`
  - Enhanced whale_ping to include: total_whales, total_volume_usd, threshold_usd, chain, contract, top_transfers (with addresses, amounts, timestamps)
  - Result: UI now receives complete whale_ping signal structure with detailed blockchain transaction data
  - Files updated: `crypto-scan/stealth_engine/stealth_signals.py` lines 453-473, `crypto-scan/stealth_engine/stealth_engine.py` lines 1074-1076

## System Architecture

The system employs a multi-stage detection pipeline for pre-pump signals, built on a Python backend using Flask for a web dashboard and a dedicated background scanning service. Data storage primarily utilizes JSON files for caching, alerts, reports, and configuration.

**Key Architectural Decisions & Design Patterns:**

-   **Multi-Agent Consensus Engine**: A primary decision-making mechanism utilizing a 5-agent system (Analyzer, Reasoner, Voter, Debater, Decider) for evaluating each detector's output and reaching a unified decision (BUY/HOLD/AVOID), often integrating with OpenAI's GPT for real AI reasoning. Alerts are triggered only from consensus BUY decisions.
-   **Multi-Stage Detection**: A 4-stage process (micro-anomaly, news/tag analysis, market rhythm/tension, breakout initiation) for comprehensive signal identification.
-   **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic thresholds for whale detection and smart money triggers, adjusting based on market conditions and historical performance.
-   **Component-Aware Feedback Loop**: A self-learning decay system automatically adjusts the weights of detection components based on their real-time effectiveness and historical performance.
-   **Unified Alert System**: Centralized Telegram alert management ensures consistent message formatting, intelligent cooldowns, and detailed transparency. Alerts are processed in real-time with strict BUY-ONLY filtering, sent immediately upon consensus decision, and require a minimum of 2 active detectors.
-   **Modular Design**: Components like the pump verification system, feedback loops, and various AI detectors are designed as modular units.
-   **Robust Error Handling & Fallbacks**: Comprehensive error handling, timeout protections, and intelligent fallback mechanisms (e.g., OpenAI API retries with exponential backoff and fallback to gpt-3.5-turbo) ensure continuous operation.
-   **UI/UX**: A Flask-based web dashboard (port 5000) provides real-time monitoring, utilizing HTML templates with Bootstrap for a responsive design and JavaScript for dynamic updates.
-   **Core Technical Implementations & Features**:
    -   **PPWCS Scoring**: A Pre-Pump Weighted Composite Score (0-100) is calculated based on detected signals.
    -   **Advanced Detectors**: Specialized detection for market anomalies (heatmap exhaustion, orderbook spoofing, VWAP pinning, volume cluster analysis).
    -   **Smart Money Detection**: Integrates a trigger system with minimum thresholds for whale addresses, a whale memory system, and DEX inflow analysis with address trust management.
    -   **Pump Verification System**: Uses machine learning for comprehensive pump classification, including automatic cleanup of old data.
    -   **Priority Alert Queue**: Prioritizes alerts based on a computed score, allowing dynamic time windows and instant alerts.
    -   **GNN-based Stealth Engine**: Leverages Graph Neural Networks for blockchain transaction analysis, anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning.
    -   **Wallet Behavior Encoder**: Generates behavioral embeddings from transaction histories for whale classification.
    -   **Contextual Chart Generation**: Generates TradingView-style charts with contextual overlays for Vision-AI training.
    -   **Individual Multi-Agent Processing**: The Multi-Agent Consensus System uses individual OpenAI API calls per detector (1 call per detector for all 5 agents) rather than batch processing, providing better reliability and easier debugging for each detector's 5-agent evaluation.
    -   **GPT-5 Integration**: The system utilizes GPT-5 for enhanced AI capabilities across all OpenAI API calls, providing superior crypto analysis and reasoning.
    -   **Canonical Price System**: Single frozen price per token per scan round eliminates dispersed price fallback logic, ensuring consistent pricing across all modules and agents.
    -   **Chain Router System**: Consistent (chain, contract) mapping across whale_ping and dex_inflow modules prevents chain mismatches like WIF ethereum vs Solana routing inconsistencies.
