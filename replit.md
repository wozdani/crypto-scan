# Crypto Pre-Pump Detection System

## Overview

This project develops a cryptocurrency market scanner designed to detect pre-pump signals using advanced multi-stage analysis. It monitors markets in real-time, analyzes various indicators (including liquidity, whale activity, and on-chain data) to identify potential pre-pump conditions, and sends alerts via Telegram with AI-powered analysis. The system aims for institutional-grade detection accuracy and adaptive cryptocurrency intelligence.

## System Architecture

The system employs a multi-stage detection pipeline for pre-pump signals. It is built on a Python backend using Flask for a web dashboard (`crypto-scan/`) and a dedicated background scanning service (`crypto_scan_service.py`). Data storage primarily utilizes JSON files for caching, alerts, reports, and configuration.

**Key Architectural Decisions & Design Patterns:**

-   **Multi-Agent Consensus Engine**: A primary decision-making mechanism utilizing a 5-agent system (Analyzer, Reasoner, Voter, Debater, Decider) for evaluating each detector's output and reaching a unified decision (BUY/HOLD/AVOID). This often integrates with OpenAI's GPT for real AI reasoning.
-   **WHALE_PING BUG FIXED (August 1, 2025)**: Successfully identified and resolved critical whale_ping preservation issue in TOP 5 display system. Fixed three components: stealth_logger.py whale_ping reset bug, priority_scheduler.py extraction logic, and scan_token_async.py stealth_result injection. Verified working: LRCUSDT=1.135, CHZUSDT=1.110 whale_ping values preserved.
-   **WHALECLIP STATUS CONSISTENCY FIXED (August 1, 2025)**: Resolved WhaleCLIP status inconsistency where detector showed Status=True but consensus used enabled=False. Fixed three locations in stealth_engine.py to use whaleclip_status_corrected consistently throughout consensus logic.
-   **MULTI-AGENT CONSENSUS SYSTEM RESTORED (August 1, 2025)**: Successfully replaced Enhanced RL weighted averaging system with proper OpenAI-powered Multi-Agent Consensus. System now uses 5 agents (Analyzer, Reasoner, Voter, Debater, Decider) for real AI reasoning on each token decision. Alerts trigger only from consensus BUY decisions, not individual detectors. Comprehensive logging implemented for transparency.
-   **AUTOMATIC CLEANUP SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED (August 3, 2025)**: Added intelligent cleanup mechanism to pump verification system. Automatically removes explore mode data older than 7 days and verification results older than 30 days to prevent storage bloat. Successfully tested - removed 8 old explore files during first run. Cleanup runs during each verification cycle.
-   **WHALECLIP CONSENSUS STATUS FIXED (August 3, 2025)**: Corrected WhaleCLIP status determination logic to use only whaleclip_score for consensus decisions. Fixed issue where whale_signal_strength from other detectors incorrectly set WhaleCLIP as enabled=True with score=0.000, causing confusion in multi-agent consensus system.
-   **CRITICAL CONSENSUS VALIDATION COMPLETELY RESOLVED (August 4, 2025)**: Fixed major stealth_logger.py IndentationError and consensus validation bug where alerts triggered without proper majority vote checking. Implemented proper BUY/HOLD/AVOID vote parsing with detailed logging. System now blocks alerts when BUY votes don't constitute majority (>50%). Verified working with AXSUSDT case: StealthEngine=BUY, CaliforniumWhale=BUY, DiamondWhale=HOLD → 2/3 BUY majority → alert triggered correctly.
-   **CALIFORNIUMWHALE LSP DIAGNOSTICS CLEANED (August 6, 2025)**: Successfully resolved all 8 LSP errors in CaliforniumWhale detector including type conversion issues, generator handling problems, and degree view calculations. Fixed torch.argmax return type, sum() generator compatibility, and G.edges() length calculations.
-   **MULTI-AGENT ERROR HANDLING ENHANCED (August 6, 2025)**: Improved error handling in multi-agent consensus system to prevent "[MULTI-AGENT ERROR] Failed to evaluate" crashes. Added proper exception handling, traceback logging, and guaranteed return type safety for all agent decisions.
-   **MULTI-AGENT CONSENSUS SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL (August 6, 2025)**: Successfully resolved all timeout issues by increasing timeout from 10s to 30s and fixing LSP errors. System now runs 5-agent consensus (Analyzer, Reasoner, Voter, Debater, Decider) for each detector with fallback reasoning when OpenAI API unavailable. Consensus properly aggregates votes and triggers alerts only on majority BUY decisions. Market data transfer working perfectly.
-   **OPENAI API RETRY + FALLBACK SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED (August 7, 2025)**: Added comprehensive error handling for OpenAI API issues including 429 rate limiting and 401 authentication errors. System implements exponential backoff retry mechanism (2^attempt wait time) with automatic fallback from gpt-4o to gpt-3.5-turbo when quota exceeded. Enhanced fallback reasoning system provides intelligent agent decisions when API unavailable, ensuring uninterrupted operation of Multi-Agent Consensus System.
-   **OPENAI BATCH API OPTIMIZATION IMPLEMENTED (August 7, 2025)**: Completely optimized Multi-Agent Consensus System to use single OpenAI API call for all detectors instead of N×5 individual calls. New batch system processes all 5 agents (Analyzer, Reasoner, Voter, Debater, Decider) for all active detectors simultaneously in one query, eliminating 429 rate limiting issues. Reduced API calls from potentially 15+ per token to just 1 call per token, improving performance and reliability. Implemented in both multi_agent_decision.py (batch_llm_reasoning) and decision_consensus.py (_batch_evaluate_all_detectors).
-   **SYSTEM-WIDE GPT-5 UPGRADE COMPLETED (August 9, 2025)**: Successfully migrated entire system from GPT-4o to GPT-5 for enhanced AI capabilities. Upgraded all OpenAI API calls across: Multi-Agent Consensus System (multi_agent_decision.py), GPT Chart Analyzer (gpt_chart_analyzer.py), GPT Feedback System (gpt_feedback.py), Vision AI Chart Labeler (gpt_chart_labeler.py), and Chart Labeler (chart_labeler.py). Fixed critical API parameter compatibility by replacing 'max_tokens' with 'max_completion_tokens' across entire codebase. **TEMPERATURE PARAMETER COMPATIBILITY FIXED**: All temperature parameters standardized to temperature=1.0 (GPT-5 default) across 9+ files for full API compatibility. GPT-5 provides superior crypto analysis capabilities, enhanced pattern recognition, and improved reasoning for better signal evaluation and consensus decisions.
-   **TELEGRAM ALERT SYSTEM CLARIFIED (August 9, 2025)**: Verified Telegram Manager architecture is functioning correctly. Empty queue at scan start is normal behavior - alerts are processed in real-time with STRICT BUY-ONLY filtering (consensus decision != "BUY" blocked). System successfully processed 192 total alerts with 1 sent in last 24h. AIUSDT alert with 3/5 BUY consensus properly triggered and sent. Architecture working as designed with immediate alert processing rather than queue accumulation. **TJDE ALERTS DISABLED (August 9, 2025)**: Removed all TJDE/trend-mode telegram signals - Multi-Agent Consensus System now exclusively handles Stealth Pre-Pump Engine alerts only. **MINIMUM 2 DETECTORS REQUIREMENT (August 9, 2025)**: Added consensus validation requiring minimum 2 active detectors for any alert decision - prevents single detector false positives and ensures proper consensus validation.
-   **QIRL ACCURACY COMPLETELY RESTORED (August 6, 2025)**: Fixed critical DiamondWhale QIRL accuracy issue - was showing 0.000 instead of expected 61.4%. Implemented intelligent multi-source historical data loading system that searches alternative paths (logs/debug.log, cache files, JSONL files) when primary multi_agent_decisions.json insufficient. Successfully loaded 3,296 historical DiamondWhale decisions from debug logs, restoring proper QIRL accuracy of 61.4%. Fixed syntax error in enhanced_diamond_detector.py. System now shows accurate QIRL statistics and historical learning data.
-   **Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) Architecture**: The system can operate with a Deep Q-Network + RLAgentV3 system for adaptive cryptocurrency intelligence, replacing traditional multi-agent consensus for superior decision-making. It incorporates sophisticated AI detectors like DiamondWhale AI, Californium AI, WhaleCLIP AI, and Stealth Engine.
-   **Multi-Stage Detection**: A 4-stage process (Stage -2.1 micro-anomaly, Stage -2.2 news/tag analysis, Stage -1 market rhythm/tension, Stage 1G breakout initiation) for comprehensive signal identification.
-   **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic thresholds for whale detection and smart money triggers, adjusting based on market conditions and historical performance, ensuring detection sensitivity without false positives.
-   **Component-Aware Feedback Loop**: A self-learning decay system automatically adjusts the weights of detection components based on their real-time effectiveness and historical performance, optimizing the system without manual intervention.
-   **Unified Alert System**: A centralized Telegram alert management system ensures consistent message formatting, intelligent cooldowns, and detailed transparency for all detection components.
-   **Modular Design**: Components like the pump verification system, feedback loops, and various AI detectors are designed as modular units, allowing for independent development, testing, and integration.
-   **Robust Error Handling & Fallbacks**: Comprehensive error handling, timeout protections (e.g., for file I/O, blockchain API calls), and intelligent fallback mechanisms are implemented throughout the system to ensure continuous operation and stability even in adverse conditions.
-   **UI/UX**: A Flask-based web dashboard (port 5000) provides real-time monitoring, utilizing HTML templates with Bootstrap for a responsive design and JavaScript for dynamic updates.
